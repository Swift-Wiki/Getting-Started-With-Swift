Learning to Develop iOS Apps
==================

The most common reason people learn Swift is to develop iOS apps. If that's what you want to do, you've come to the right place.

There are two primary frameworks that make it possible to create iOS apps: UIKit and SwiftUI. UIKit is what developers have been using since iOS 2 when Apple first allowed native app development. SwiftUI is very new and, at this point in time, you most likely can't develop an app without also knowing some UIKit.

Debugging

We almost never write code perfectly the first time. Diagnosing and fixing bugs is a critical skill for any developer.
