Learning to Develop iOS Apps
==================

The most common reason people learn Swift is to develop iOS apps. If that's what you want to do, you've come to the right place.

There are two primary frameworks that make it possible to create iOS apps: UIKit and SwiftUI. UIKit is what developers have been using since iOS 2 when Apple first allowed native app development. SwiftUI is very new and, at this point in time, you most likely can't develop an app without also knowing some UIKit.

UIKit
-------------

UIKit is a very large framework at this point. Here are the various components you will want to learn.

# Musts

- Interface Development – Creating what the user sees and interacts with on the screen
- Navigation – Allowing the user to navigate between different parts of your app
- App Life Cycle - Managing the starting, stopping, and much more of your app

# Other

- Web Requests – Sending/getting data to/from the interenet
- Camera – Taking pictures and/or video using the devices camera
